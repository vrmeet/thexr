TODO:

Once stored, we need a way to serialize it to the front end so we can load it in 3d.  

1) After entity is created, view the entity in the scene.
2) When the entity is clicked, we can edit the components with a form
3) Or click and position the entity in the scene, and have the form update too
4) Any connected clients get the updates too

===

Then we need a way to broadcast the create/delete/update changes of entities and their components to other connected users
