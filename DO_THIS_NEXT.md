TODO:

the svelte side needs access to edit settings (we lost this functionality when we removed the iframe)

- edit mode should have a tools overlay in inline mode, a collapsable
  hand menu in immersive-vr
- add point to pick / select an entity
- add gizmos so can edit by click and dragging

- add back teleportation
- keep track of teleporatable floors   
- track left and right hand controllers
- move the immersive button from right hand corner into the menu area
- add pick/up and throwable objects

Easy way to add image wall
add some simple behavior
add some sound
add a gun
add a monster




 
- render skybox behind everything

- add video/cam and screen sharing 

- add cylinder type

- animate changes so we see things slide into place
- have edit mode where you can click and move with the pointer (on hover pull up menu to launch gizmos)

- mobile movement joystick


- make a hamburger menu button (in VR make mounted to left hand)
- menu button pulls up advanced dynamic texture for a mesh : https://doc.babylonjs.com/divingDeeper/gui/gui#texture-mode

- learn how to hook up button events to code
- click a primative button to place it in the scene
- as long as 




- consider getting rid of the edit 'slug' for a space.  people don't know what it means.  and it is subject to 
  abuse if people reserve the best short slugs or spell things we don't want.  What if every space was
  browsible but was public or private.  the slug is still there but not changable except by admin.

- remove template and plugin models/migrations
