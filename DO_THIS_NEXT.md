TODO:

- iframe menu doesn't seem like it will support more advanced interactions like modals and search
and the ability to interact with the scene at the same time (create a maze).  For that it seems like react might be a better solution, especially if there are a large number of entities.
- learn some react?

- add fog, gravity, clear color to a space

- make a hamburger menu button (in VR make mounted to left hand)
- menu button pulls up advanced dynamic texture for a mesh : https://doc.babylonjs.com/divingDeeper/gui/gui#texture-mode

- learn how to hook up button events to code
- click a primative button to place it in the scene
- as long as 

- add point to pick / select an entity
- add gizmos so can edit by click and dragging
- test editing in oculus
- add thexr.space domain to gigalixr
- add some intro text about how this is beta test
